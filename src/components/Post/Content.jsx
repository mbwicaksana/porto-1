          There is an “architectural shift” in technology and in the world
          brought upon by cryptoassets, which many crypto supporters miss,
          according to Marc Andreessen, co-founder of venture capital powerhouse
          Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), and founder of Netscape Communications
          Corporation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, a16z announced a new USD 2.2bn fund to continue investing in
          crypto networks.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meanwhile, in a recent interview with economic blogger Noah Smith,
          Andreessen compared the topic of crypto with the parable of the blind
          men and the elephant, allowing people to interpret many different
          parts in many different ways, or use it to make their point. As an
          example, he gave people seizing on “the money part,” then either
          glorifying crypto as a new type of monetary system that brings freedom
          from the nation-state, or “crucify[ing] it as a danger to economic
          stability and the ability for governments to tax.”
          <br />
          <br />
          However, while these are interesting arguments, Andreessen stressed,
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="text-center text-xl font-bold italic text-accent lg:text-2xl">
            “I think they all miss a more fundamental point, which is that
            crypto represents an architectural shift in how technology works and
            therefore how the world works. That architectural shift is called
            distributed consensus — the ability for many untrusted participants
            in a network to establish consistency and trust.”

          <br />
          According to him, the Internet has never had this until now and it
          will take thirty years to work through all of the things that can be
          done as a result. While money is the easiest application of this idea,
          other things that can now be built in theory include Internet native
          contracts, loans, insurance, title to real-world assets, unique
          digital goods aka non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and online corporate
          structures such as digital autonomous organizations (DAOs), among
          others, the investor said.
          <br />
          <br />
          This also presents a great impact on and shift in incentives – which
          further impacts reaching these applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          Collaborative human effort online so far was either in the form of a
          literal adoption of real-world corporate norms, such as a company with
          a website, or an open-source project like Linux that didn’t have any
          money directly attached to it, said Andreessen.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="text-center text-xl font-bold italic text-accent lg:text-2xl">
            “With crypto, you can now create thousands of new kinds of incentive
            systems for collaborative work online, since participants in a
            crypto project can get paid directly without a real-world company
            even needing to exist,” he said.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          While open-source software development has been great, people are
          generally willing to work more for money than for free, “and all of a
          sudden all those things become possible and even easy to do.” And
          though it will take a few decades to see the results of this as well,
          “I don’t think it’s crazy that this could be a civilizational shift in
          how people work and get paid,” said Andreessen.
          <br />
          <br />
          He also discussed the idea that AI is somewhat a left-wing idea,
          having centralized machines making top-down decisions, but that crypto
          is a right-wing idea, having many distributed agents, humans and bots,
          making bottom-up decisions, he said, citing another prominent venture
          capitalist Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal.
          <br />
          <br />
          The tech industry has historically been dominated by left-wing
          politics and today’s big tech companies are intertwined with the US
          Democratic Party, Andreessen said, noting,
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="text-center text-xl font-bold italic text-accent lg:text-2xl">
            “Crypto potentially represents the creation of a whole new category
            of technology, quite literally right-wing tech that is far more
            aggressively decentralized and far more comfortable with
            entrepreneurialism and free voluntary exchange. If you believe, as I
            do, that the world needs far more technology, this is a very
            powerful idea, a step function increase in what the technology world
            can do.”
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          As for a16z becoming known for innovating in the space of venture
          capital itself, Andreessen said that there is something old and
          something new about venture capital – and this something new includes
          crypto.
          <br />
          <br />
          “So we sit at the vortex of this combination of the very old and the
          very new. It’s certainly possible that venture capital itself gets
          pulled into this vortex and comes out the other side radically
          transformed, and in fact, this is what some of the smartest crypto
          experts are predicting,” Andreessen concluded.
